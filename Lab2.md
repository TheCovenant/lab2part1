### 6 - OSS Idea

An open source software that I feel I could contribute on is Quacs. A feature that I feel would be beneficial would be to enter what requirements one needs to graduate and be able to filter classes that will satisfy those requirements. I could contribute by cloning their github repo and working on commits and pull requests.
